# RRT Trajectory Planner

Problem Statement:

Given a starting position (xs, ys), a target position (xt, yt), and a list of the convex hull points for each obstacle, find a feasible trajectory for an omnidirectional circular robot with radius r to follow to get to the target position avoiding obstacle collisions.
